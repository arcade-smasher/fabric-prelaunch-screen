# fabric-prelaunch-screen
Fabric lacks a built-in prelaunch screen like Forge. This mod adds one, designed to closely mimic Forge's prelaunch screen.

Due to Fabric's initialization process, the screen can only appear after Fabric and its mixins are loaded, so it may appear slightly later than Forge's prelaunch screen.
